The Challenge was to recreate the given desktop and mobile designs as close as possible.

The important part was that the design should be responsive and accessible for all users and devices.

Reference Designs:

## Goals

- Write Clean, Readable CSS.
- Really focusing on responsiveness and making sure that the design looks good across all screens.
  - Use media queries
  - Focus on intention behind setting properties like widths. To try and really understand what the property is doing before setting it. Being in control of what's going on and not getting lost.
- Using Flexbox and Grid smartly.
- Writing Accessible Code.
- Documenting my experience and learning.

## What I Learnt

Pretty happy with the time it took me to complete this challenge (3 hours of work), despite it being pretty simple.

I feel like I understand how to tackle layouts like this pretty well now. I am finally figuring out a workflow to tackle these challenges. I am also learning that everything can't be pixel perfect and learning to let go of obsessing over making everything look perfect.

I also found and used a bunch of tools in this challenge like Microsoft Power Toys for window layouts, color picker; Greenshot for measurements; a bunch of VSCode Extensions, and some new CSS Reset code snippets. I have been learning for over a month now, and I wonder if there is anything wrong with someone at my stage to use tools and extensions/ is it better to get vanilla practice?

Also, Grid is amazing haha.
